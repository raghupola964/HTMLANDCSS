        1. Display Pixels:

These are the physical pixels on your screen that display the webpage's content.
The number of pixels on your screen determines the resolution, which impacts how sharp and detailed the images and text appear.   
Web developers design websites to be responsive, meaning they adjust to different screen sizes and resolutions.   
2. Tracking Pixels:

These are tiny, invisible images (usually 1x1 pixel) embedded in the code of a webpage.   
They are used for tracking user behavior and gathering information about website visitors.   
Tracking pixels can be used for various purposes, such as:
Measuring website traffic and engagement   
Tracking conversions (e.g., purchases, form submissions)   
Retargeting ads to users who have visited the website   
Analyzing user demographics and interests
